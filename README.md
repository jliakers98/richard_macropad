# richard_macropad

8*5 macropad intended for use with stupid 2x2u keycaps on the corners
a bit silly really

intended for handwiring, case is pushfit assembly with room for a usb-c extender to "convert" a pro micro.
two holes for reset wires because i dont have any small switches on hand and dont want to order any :)
